# DigitalSecurityARG

This is a prototype developed by Benetech in an attempt to create a artificial reality platform for testing digital security best practices. The tool is intended to be used by organizational leaders to enroll their fieldworkers in digital security simulations in order to test their readiness, assess the efficacy of training materials, and provide in-context training in response to real-time actions taken in the simulations.


The first pilot of the platform is a Phishing simulation in which enrolled participants will recieve several customized, simulated phishing emails. The platform will administer the simulations across the organization, and supply follow-up statisctics to the teamleader with summative data concerning which participants opened the email, clicked the contained URLs, submitted credentials to the phony site, or downloaded and opened potentially malicious files.


Below are some example screenshots of phishing emails and phony websites used in some of the simulations:

The team leaders can manage, review, and administer simulations through the administrative console:
